## Description
    This is a website for my incredible husband, David Moore, who is a Licensed Professional Engineer, (P.E.) in Houston, Texas.

    While my husband is not an entrepreneur, I decided to create a fun, mock-up website in his honor to gain some practice with front-end development. 
    
    I've created the logo for this site and played with typography and corporate fonts which I very much enjoyed. We do not claim rights to any of the photos and work shown does not reflect buildings engineered by David Moore.
    
    Enjoy!  

    Technologies include:  
    HTML, CSS, Javascript.
